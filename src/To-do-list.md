# TO DO:

1. 

2. You need to fix the images issue. Because the final invoice doesn’t even have the logo. So that’s a problem.

3. Retain values on Routing when back button clicked

4. Validation of inputs - add rules

5. Error handling

6. Due date calculation

7. Unit labels - currency and percentages
